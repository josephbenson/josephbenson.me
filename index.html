						<p> My name is Joseph. This is my experiment with learning to code. But we won’t talk about that. </p>

						<p> I’ve spent a huge part of my grown life pretending to be a good designer. I’m still trying to be one. I’ve gone from designing fliers for small events to designing interfaces for applications that millions of people interact with. But I’ve never felt amazed by my design skills. I see a ton of people around me who do better stuff everyday. </p>

						<p> At first it scared me to think that I’d never be good enough. Lots of times, I thought about dumping this whole design thing and going back to school to get some education, finishing with a good grade and getting a stable job. But I had failed at that before and I wasn’t quite convinced I wouldn’t fail again. So I just kept working through moments of depression and uncertainty.Fast forward a couple of long sad years, I’ve finally begun to let go of my doubts. I’ve found what my real role is as a designer. </p>

						<p> You see, I’m a really good thinker. Especially when it comes to solving design problems in web and mobile applications. I help breakdown user interaction problems that might have seemed rather complex to a lot of people. I’m also quite skilled at understanding business objectives, making sure to create a balance between them and delivering a sensible user experiences for people who use these digital products. I work really well when I surround myself with amazing designers and developers, working hand in hand to solve problems for people. </p>
	 
						<p> This is really the kind of designer that I am. I try to avoid giving it a tag, as I’ve found that to be quite polarising for many. So I just wear whatever title my workplace gives me. :) </p>

						<p> I’ve spent the past fews years honing these skills and I’m not even close to stopping. In the past, I worked on platforms to help people find jobs and help people find places. Currently, I’m helping design solutions that enable people make online transactions securely. </p>

						<p> Though a bit of an introvert, I find people very interesting and would not pass up an opportunity to hangout or chat about life and work if time permits. </p>
